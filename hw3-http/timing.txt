I think both connect times are similar because even with the keep-alive, we're only making one request, which doesn't show the true
benefit of having keep-alive. To see an actual improvement with a keep-alive implementation, we would need to send multiple requests to the 
open tcp connection so that we are not making additional network requests that we would when having a connection: closed approach.
